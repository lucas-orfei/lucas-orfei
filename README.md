### Hi, I'm Lucas!

Iâ€™m a masterâ€™s student in astroparticle physics at the Federal University of ABC, and I have been taking courses and trainings to get experience in data science.

I am also passionate about science and I founded a science communication project, Aurora CiÃªncia, with the aim of bringing science from universities to society. You can view the project at [Aurora CiÃªncia](https://auroraciencia.com.br/).
